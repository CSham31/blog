I\nwill discuss about MCUs in another article soon.\n\n\n\nSo let's make it work.\n\nYou may required these.\n\n * STM32 Development Board \n   \n   \n   \n * FTDI Programmer or STLink\n   \n   \n   \n * a Breadboard*\n   \n   \n   \n * Some Jumper wires\n   \n   \n   \n * a Laptop \n   \n   \n   \n\nWith FTDI programmer\nconnect FTDI to STM using jumpers.\n\nFTDISTMVCC5VGNDGNDRXA9TXA10\n\n 1. Go to Arduino IDE. Files > Preferences.\n    \n    \n 2. Paste this URL in the Additional Board Manager URLs tab > OK\n    http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json\n    \n    \n    \n    (if there are some links already use the button to exoand the window then\n    paste the link.)\n    \n    \n 3. Go to Tools > Boards > Board Manager.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n 4. Search for stm. Click install.\n\n\n\n 5. Set settings as following for FTDI.\n\n\n\n 6. Select the COM port.\n\n * read the last steps before upload\n\nWith STLink\nonly few steps have to change from above. Im currently using a Windows Laptop.so\nsome of these steps may chang for Mac OS Laptops.\n\n * Download necessary drivers\n   [https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stsw-link009.html] for STLink first.\n   Install it. When you plug the STLINK to your computer after that it may look\n   like this. ( for older STLinks use STSW-LINK007 )\n\n 1. Go to Arduino IDE. Files > Preferences.\n    \n    \n 2. Paste this URL in the Additional Board Manager URLs tab > OK\n    http://dan.drown.org/stm32duino/package_STM32duino_index.json\n    \n    \n    \n    (if there are some links already use the button to exoand the window then\n    paste the link.)\n    \n    \n 3. Go to Tools > Boards > Board Manager.\n    \n    \n\n\n\n 4. Search for stm. Click install.\n\n\n\n 5. Set settings as following for STLink.\n\n\n\n 6. Select the COM port.\n\nlast steps.\nHave you notices that, there are 2 male headers marked as BOOT0, BOOT1. Read\nthis part carefully. Using these 2 BOOT pins we can configure BOOT memories.\n\nBOOT1BOOT0BOOT MODEx0Main Flash memory01System memory11Embedded SRAMTo upload\ncode to flash memory ,\n\n * Set BOOT0 --> 1 | BOOT1 --> 0.\n\nAfter upload the code,\n\n * set BOOT0 --> 0 .\n   By this we only reprogram flash memory.\n\nWhy don't we upload codes via USB code directly ?\nsimple answer. Upload through USB require a Bootloader, which not include when\nwe purchase this MCU. Wecan flash the Bootloader by one of above methods. Then\nwe can use USB port for upload the code. I will upload descriptive article for\nthat task.\n\n> stay tuned","feature_image":"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553341640-6b28ff92098a?crop=entropy&cs=tinysrgb&fit=max&fm=jpg&ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fDMyJTIwYml0fGVufDB8fHw&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&q=80&w=2000","featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"none","author_id":"1","created_at":"2020-12-15 20:05:15","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2020-12-24 21:18:03","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2020-12-15 20:54:24","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5fd917171363b2018c5c951b","uuid":"7c9e22f2-2db2-4969-b23d-b46f24f41b09","title":"vscode for Arduino","slug":"vscode-for-arduino","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"markdown\",{\"markdown\":\"**vscode** is a light weight **code editor**.
